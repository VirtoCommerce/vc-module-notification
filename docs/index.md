### Notification Layouts

VC Notification module provides email notification template layout functionality so you can simplify email notification management of footer, header, etc.

1. On the 'Notifications' menu select 'Notification layouts' and add a new layout. Layout body is a Liquid template that will be populated by email content on rendering. Define a special variable, for example `content`, and place it between your html header and footer, for example: 
```html
<div>HEADER</div>
     {{ content }}
<div>FOOTER</div>
```

2. Open email template. For layout to render correctly you need to first select it in the Layout dropdown. Then after selecting a layout you need to provide content for the `content` variable defined inside the layout earlier. You can do it by placing it inside `capture` clause, for example:
```liquid
{% capture content %}
     Renders the content by captured <strong>content</strong> keyword. <br />
     Can use template variables: <strong>{{ customer_order.number }}</strong> 
{% endcapture %}
``` 
3. You can check correctness of your email notification by clicking the Preview button:

*Note*: you can have more than one content variable in a layout, they will be rendered as long as captured inside the notification template.

4. Save changes to the notification template.

### Notification logs

VC Notification module saves notification activity logs and store them under 'Notification sending log'.

To view the sending logs, select the notification, open 'Notification details' and select the 'Send log' widget.
The system will display the existing logs on the 'Notification sending logs' blade.
